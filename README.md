## What's this?
The "Attendance List" is a system to visualise all registrated users with their current location on a map. Alternatively, each user can set a location status (Office, Out Of Office, Holiday, Leisure Time). It was originally created to have an overview of the location from all members of a Stab in a Swiss Army Bataillon.
